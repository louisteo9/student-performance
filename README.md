# student-performance
This databook develops model to predict student performance on math course in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. We will apply regression technique to the dataset.

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

This workbook demonstrates how the entire machine learning workflow is applied from start to finish. 

## Exploratory Analysis >> Data Cleaning >> Feature Engineering >> Algorithm Selection >> Model Training



The goal of this workbook is to let you develop high-level intuition of the entire machine learning process, which is extremely important but often overlooked.

The entire model training will be performed using Jupyter Notebook.

## File Description
Student Performance.ipynb -> Jupyter Notebook for model training<br/>
student-mat.csv -> Student results on math course<br/>
student.txt -> Attributes for student-mat.csv (Math course)<br/>

## Python Libraries Used
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

## Insights & Analysis
Random Forest algorithm works well out-of-the-box without tuning on hyperparameters.
